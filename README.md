# LOTP RoboDog Prototype-1
This is my first quadruped robotic project which has still lots of things to do. I would like to share STL files, descriptions, components, instructions. But please keep in your mind that this is just a test project which helps me to learn fundamentals of this science, and prepares myself for second prototype.
